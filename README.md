# Template-Script

I’m planning to create a template library (details as follows) so that new players can easily use and customize it if they want to create their own scenarios—especially for people like me :pain:  who aren’t good at coding or English, but still want to learn how to use scripting systems. It’s made super convenient, kinda like instant noodles—but for scripts! A “semi-ready script ” :unf:  to make everything way easier. (lol) I’m currently trying to figure things out with my buddy (ChatGPT....:heynukowmanisi: ) Hehheh.
